# Optical Flow Project

Reference implementation of the event-based optical flow algorithm proposed by [Brosch et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4403305/).

For a report on the implementation, evaluation of the algorithm with regards to runtime and accuracy, we refer to our [(student) technical report (PDF)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.719.9993&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
